**Patrol Options**:

* **Enable Patrol:** If enabled the token will patrol

* **Spot Player Characters:** If enabled the token will spot player characters, pausing the game and panning on the token when spotting

**Custom Patrols**

You can have a token patrol a specific area by drawing a Polygon (other shapes are not supported) and in it's text propriety call it "Patrol" (upper case P). Any token in that area will patrol only inside that area
